subtitle: a new beginning?

It's been a while since I've had a website, so I buckled down this past week
and threw [this][kejadlen.github.io] together.

[GitHub Pages] was an obvious choice for the backend, seeing as how it's a)
free and b) simple (for me, at least). While I used [nanoc] for building [my
previous blog][kejadlen.net], I decided to go down the path of least resistance
this time and use [Jekyll with github-pages].

Despite mostly going with the flow on infrastructure, I can't help do some
things my own way. Last time, I went with [Zurb Foundation] over [Bootstrap]
(for really no good reason other than I like trying out less-popular options).
This time, I'm attempting to build mostly from-scratch on top of a few
lighter-weight libraries: [normalize.css], [Bourbon], and [Neat].

Since I'm no designer, I'm leaning on [Ethan Schoonover]'s [Solarized] and
taking some inspiration from [Tufte CSS] for the design. But mostly, I'm just
trying to avoid shooting myself in the foot in this area by keeping it simple.

## So is there anything interesting about how this blog is built?

Are you looking for something a little out of the ordinary? Well, I suppose
that how I'm doing dependency management for the CSS libraries is not normal.
Instead of downloading the files directly or using a binary delivered via
a dependency manager to install and update the library (which is a pet peeve of
mine, but I'll leave that rant for a future post), I've [vendored][vendor] the
dependencies using [`git` submodules][git-submodule] and [symlinked][symlink]
the libraries into the [`_sass` directory][sass].

This might seem like overkill, but I don't want to introduce additional tooling
unless absolutely necessary and as already mentioned, I hate installing tools
via dependency managers. Submodules make updating from upstream trivial (`git
submodule update --recursive`) and symlinks mean that if I need to make my own
changes (which shouldn't be necessary for this project), I don't need to jump
through hoops and can just update the files directly and then commit/push from
the submodule.
