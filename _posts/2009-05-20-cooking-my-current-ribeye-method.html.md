title: "Cooking: My Current Ribeye Method"
---
This is how I currently (as of 2009.05.20) like to cook my steaks. This may change in the future as I learn more, but for now, it strikes the right balance between taste and convenience.

My preferred cut is a ribeye. I haven't actually tried all the other cuts out myself, but the ribeye is supposed to be fattier, which certainly agrees with what I've experienced so far.

The actual preparation and cooking is straightforward:

1. Bring the steak up to room temperature.
1. Start the grill, with the temperature turned almost to the maximum.
1. Rub oil, salt, and pepper into each side of the steak.
1. Place the steak on the grill.
1. Wait four minutes.
1. Flip the ribeye.
1. Wait another four minutes.
1. Take the steak off the heat onto a plate.
1. Cover and let it sit for a few minutes.
1. Eat.

So that's the way I like to grill my steaks. Simple and tasty, nothing complicated.
