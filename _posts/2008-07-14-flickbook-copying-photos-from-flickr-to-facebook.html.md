title: "Flickbook: Copying photos from Flickr to Facebook"
---
Got bored over the weekend, and decided to make my life easier by writing a Flickr Set to Facebook Album converter. For a GUI, I used Camping, as it doesn’t need to be particularly complicated. I wrote Flickr and Facebook interfaces from scratch, mostly because I needed a fairly limited subset of the functionality their APIs provide.

I’m not releasing the URL since it’s hosted on my home server and I don’t really have the bandwidth, but if you want to play with it, ping me and I’ll let you know. (You can probably guess what it is if you’re familiar with my other projects.)

Anyhow, [the code’s available on github](http://github.com/kejadlen/flickbook/) for anyone who wants to use it themselves. Note that you’ll need Flickr and Facebook API keys.

There’s nothing particularly interesting about the code, but it was fun to implement the APIs from scratch. It was surprisingly easy, taking a few hours of work and coming in just over 200 LOC.
