title: Addressbar keywords in IE
---
Apparently, you can actually use keywords in IE, just like you would with Firefox. Except that creating them is much more of a pain. You need to go into the registry and add a new key under `HKCU/Software/Microsoft/Internet Explorer/SearchUrl/`. The name of the key will be the keyword and the default value the URL. Just like with Firefox, a `%s` in the URL will be replaced by any words following the keyword when you use it.

Crazy.
