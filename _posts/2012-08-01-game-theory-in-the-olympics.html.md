title: Game theory in the Olympics

I assume that by now, pretty much everyone has heard about the [four women's doubles badminton teams being disqualified for throwing their matches](http://www.nbcolympics.com/news-blogs/badminton/all-eight-women-disqualified-for-throwing-badminton-matches.html). I wanted to resume blogging by writing about switching to [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/), but couldn't resist chiming in on this topic instead!

Being an ultimate player who strongly believes in the "spirit of the game", I'm disappointed in the players. But as someone who also very much believes in "playing to win", I can't ignore the faults in the tournament format either. I guess that although I understand the situation, I'm still disappointed in pretty much everyone involved.

Sirlin has some excellent commentary in his post on the topic, [Playing to Win in Badminton](http://www.sirlin.net/blog/2012/8/1/playing-to-win-in-badminton.html):

> Whenever a "spirit of the game" clause is enforced, it's a failure of the
> rules. I might go so far as to say it \*always\* shows wrongdoing on the part
> of the tournament organizers.

> If they want pools to have top 2 that continue to a single elimination
> bracket, then the exact seeding must not be knowable ahead of time. (To avoid
> cheating from the judges, the exact rules for determining the single elim
> bracket could be written down ahead of time for that particular event, and
> held by a trusted 3rd party to verify that they were followed, and not made-up
> on the spot to favor someone.) That would have solved this particular problem,
> though even then, round-robin pools have other problems that I mentioned with
> lame ducks and kingmakers. Double elimination pools would solve those problems
> because there are \*never\* lame duck players in a double elimination bracket.
> Anyone still in the bracket can win. Also it reliably determines top 2, which

(As an aside, I wonder what he would say about ultimate's "spirit of the game" concept.)
