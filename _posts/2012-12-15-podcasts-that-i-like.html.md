### [Day[9]TV](http://day9.tv/)

Even though I don't particularly care about Starcraft II, I quite enjoy Sean Plott's enthusiasm for the subject and his amusing antics on this daily video podcast. I'll often have this on in the background, not particularly paying much attention and often skipping entire episodes at a time.

### [EngineerGuy](http://www.engineerguy.com/)

Another video podcast, but a much easier one to regularly watch since each episode is only 5-10 minutes. Bill Hammack explains neat engineering details behind a variety of cool technology in an extremely accessible manner. The video format is well suited for the topic, as the visualizations add a lot to the explanations.

### [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/)

This is my programming podcast, and something I use to generally keep tabs on concepts/technologies/etc that I might find interesting. Not every weekly topic is of interest to me, so I'll pay a varying amount of attention to this depending on what the hosts are talking about. One of my favorite parts of this podcast is the "picks" segment at the end of each show, where everyone will chime in with something neat that they recommend.

### [Three Moves Ahead](http://flashofsteel.com/index.php/three-moves-ahead/)

A podcast about strategy games and their design (mostly video games, but occassionally venturing into board game territory as well). They often have game designers as guests to talk about their games and design choices.

### [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/)

This podcast discusses aspects of design in the everyday world (mostly with architecture) that you probably never even notice. It's another one that's easy to keep up to date on, with 5-10 minute episode lengths. I liked this one enough to contribute to the Kickstarter campaign to produce a third season.
