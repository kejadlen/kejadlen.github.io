title: '#beachconf'

At Pivotal Labs, when we're in between projects, we call it being on the
"beach". (I've heard other consultancies call it the "bench", which makes more
sense to me.) While this may sound like a dream for a lot of people, we've
found that most people get bored/burned out on beach after a few weeks. In
light of that, and to keep me more accountable, I've decided to start keeping a
log of what I'm doing on the beach.

### July 5

- Watched [What's New in Foundation][212]. This wasn't too informative; some
  nice improvements with Objective-C interop with `String`/`Range` and
  copy-on-write, but I don't use key paths or KVO a lot, so that was not as
  interesting. The addition of [Codable][codable] is greatly welcomed, though.
- Read [A Mathematician's Lament][lament]. While I agree pretty much completely
  with the overall point, I did think it was overly harsh on math teachers.
- Watched [Building Apps with Dynamic Type][245]. I've always been impressed by
  Apple's accessibility support as a developer (I do use a handful of
  accessibility features on iOS, but not Dynamic Type), and it's cool to see
  Apple steadily improving in this area.
  - Both designers and devs are going to have to adjust to constraints based on
    baselines instead of the space between labels.
- Poked around at [my implementation][kilo-rs] of [Build Your Own Text
  Editor][text-editor].
